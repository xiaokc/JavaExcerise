Rosie (chatbot base)
====================

Rosie is a collection of AIML and AIML 2.0 files that form a solid base for any chatbot project. Rosie is a fork of the ALICE 2.0 project that has been optimized for use on the Pandorabots platform, and subsequently modified to run on the Program AB Java distribution.
